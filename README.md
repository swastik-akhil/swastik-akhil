👋 Hello, I'm Akhil Agrawal from India.

👀 I have a keen interest in expanding my knowledge in various software technologies.

🌱 Currently, I am actively learning and exploring the realms of Web Development and Data Structures and Algorithms.

🧑‍🎓 I am enrolled in an undergraduate program, majoring in Computer Science.

💡 Beyond my academic pursuits, I actively seek out opportunities to expand my horizons. I attend tech conferences, participate in coding   competitions, and contribute to open-source projects. These experiences help me stay up-to-date with industry trends and collaborate with talented individuals worldwide.

😋 My best skill is actually eating samosas. I can eat chilly samosas with extra spices in it. Having samosa with coriander chutney gives me wiings.

📫 Love samosa as much I do. Let's talk about how awesome they are! We can code 🧑‍💻 while eating samosa!

🚀 Let's embark on this exciting journey together, aiming for infinity and beyond!
